VERSION 1.1.7
-------------

  o Graphviz view can automatic choose different types of legends,
    either on nodes, edges or both depending on the specific pathways.

  o Vigette has been reformatted: the "Quick start" section added

VERSION 1.1.6
-------------
  o Pathview can plot/integrate/compare multiple states/samples in the
    same graph. Several functions and data objects are revised:
    including pathview, keggview.native, keggview.graph,
    render.kegg.node etc. New section on multiple state data with
    working exampleshas been added.

  o Vigette has been reformatted: Data integration section splitted
    into multiple sub-sections.

VERSION 1.1.5
-------------
  o Pathview works with species where default KEGG gene ID is not
    Entrez Gene. Several functions and data objects are revised:
    including pathview, node.map, sim.mol.data, kegg.species.code,
    korg. New section on KEGG species and Gene ID usage with working
    exampleshas been added.

VERSION 1.1.3
-------------
  o Pathview paper published in Bioinformatics

VERSION 1.0.0
-------------
  o Initial release with Bioconductor

  o Main function: pathview
