VERSION 1.3.4
-------------

  o updated bods to included an extra column of id.type, the default
    gene ID type.


VERSION 1.2.4
-------------

  o updated korg to included over 600 newly added species. Pathview
    can work with 2970 species now.

  o Make returned values from pathview, keggview.native and
    keggview.graph functions invisible.

VERSION 1.2.3
-------------

  o Fixed bug in node.map function, which produces 0 values when all
    multiple genes in a node are NA's.

VERSION 1.2.2
-------------

  o Fixed bug in mol.sum function, which generates "incorrect number of
    dimension" or NA's when sum.method="median" etc.

VERSION 1.2.1
-------------

  o Fixed bug in "missing red disease gene node labels" in diease
    pathways. To avoid interfering with node coloring, set all disease
    gene labels to black instead.

VERSION 1.1.7
-------------

  o Graphviz view can automatic choose different types of legends,
    either on nodes, edges or both depending on the specific pathways.

  o Vigette has been reformatted: the "Quick start" section added

VERSION 1.1.6
-------------
  o Pathview can plot/integrate/compare multiple states/samples in the
    same graph. Several functions and data objects are revised:
    including pathview, keggview.native, keggview.graph,
    render.kegg.node etc. New section on multiple state data with
    working exampleshas been added.

  o Vigette has been reformatted: Data integration section splitted
    into multiple sub-sections.

VERSION 1.1.5
-------------
  o Pathview works with species where default KEGG gene ID is not
    Entrez Gene. Several functions and data objects are revised:
    including pathview, node.map, sim.mol.data, kegg.species.code,
    korg. New section on KEGG species and Gene ID usage with working
    exampleshas been added.

VERSION 1.1.3
-------------
  o Pathview paper published in Bioinformatics

-------------
